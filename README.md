Project Title: Weather Prediction Project

Team: Minh Huynh

Project description: I’ll be using machine learning to predict the weather in the future. By using historic weather data, dating back to 1900, I should be able to use Scikit-Learn to create a linear regression model that predicts the future weather in a given state. I will create a webpage to display the output and using Tableau for the visualizations.
